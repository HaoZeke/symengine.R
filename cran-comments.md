Comment by Martina Schmirl:

> There are still authors and copyright holders missing.
e.g. Sandia Corporation, Dale Lukas Peterson, Richard Stallman, ...

1. Copyright notice for Sandia Corporation is already
included in `inst/COPYRIGHTS` (line 36).

2. The directory 'src/upstream/benchmarks'
along with some other unnessary files in
'src/upstream' for the R package are removed.

3. Missing copyright notice for Bison parser
(src/upstream/symengine/parser/parser.tab.*)
is added to `inst/COPYRIGHTS`.

4. Missing copyright notice for cotire
(src/upstream/cmake/cotire.cmake) is added
to `inst/COPYRIGHTS`.
