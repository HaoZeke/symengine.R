## Resubmission:

Add additional notes in COPYRIGHTS.

## Response to previous comments

> I see you use th COPRIGHtS fiel, but then there you declare the files have diferent licenses, but the package and its contents can only have on elicense, so please find out if you can releicense under one common license.

As I said in previous submission comments and previous emails and emphasized in COPYRIGHTS file in this submission, the whole R package is re-licensed under GPL which is indicated using the LICENSE field. The original copyright notices are preserved as prerequisite for re-licensing and should not be confused with the license of the R package and its components.

Relicensing are permitted (see the details of the original copyright notices) by preserving
these copyright notices in the R package.

Per CRAN Repository Policy:
"Where copyrights are held by an entity other than the package authors, this 
should preferably be indicated via ‘cph’ roles in the ‘Authors@R’ field, OR 
using a ‘Copyright’ field (if necessary referring to an inst/COPYRIGHTS 
file)."

I am putting these additional copyright holders with original copyright notices in "Copyright" field, which I considered as equivalent to adding to "Authors@R" field with "cph" roles.
