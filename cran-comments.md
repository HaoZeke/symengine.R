## Notes on license

As specified in DESCRIPTION, the whole R package will be licensed under GPL. All the notices in COPYRIGHTS are either (modified) BSD, MIT or modified GPL with special exception that allows relicensing. The requirements for redistribution and relicensing can be fulfilled by preserving these copyright notices in both source and binary forms. Since the COPYRIGHTS file will be installed to the system and can be checked with R's help system, I see these requirements are already fulfilled.
