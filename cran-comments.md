## Previous notes

The whole R package is re-licensed under GPL which is indicated using the LICENSE field. The original copyright notices are preserved as prerequisite for re-licensing and should not be confused with the license of the R package and its components.

Relicensing are permitted (see the details of the original copyright notices) by preserving these copyright notices in the R package.

Per CRAN Repository Policy:
"Where copyrights are held by an entity other than the package authors, this 
should preferably be indicated via ‘cph’ roles in the ‘Authors@R’ field, OR 
using a ‘Copyright’ field (if necessary referring to an inst/COPYRIGHTS 
file)."

I am putting these additional copyright holders with original copyright notices in "Copyright" field, which I considered as equivalent to adding to "Authors@R" field with "cph" roles.
