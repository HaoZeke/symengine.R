## Version 0.1.1:

Fixed build errors on solaris and updated AUTHORS file.

## Response to previous comments

> You write that there is more information in the COPYRIGHT file. However, there is no such a file.

I wrote COPYRIGHTS file instead of COPYRIGHT file. It is located at 'inst/COPYRIGHTS' before installation and 'COPYRIGHTS' after installation. I have updated the sentence to make it more clear.

I am using AUTHORS and COPYRIGHTS files to provide details about bundled C++ library, per Writing R Extensions: "... AUTHORS or COPYRIGHTS to specify the authors or copyright holders when this is too complex to put in the DESCRIPTION file."

Thanks.
